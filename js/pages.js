            "Robert Hampshire fiddled with his pen. He spun it around his fingers until it slipped and landed on the floor. His eyes lingered on the spot where the pen landed for a few seconds; then his eyes slowly changed focus to the fluorescence light that showered the room in a dull bauge glow. &#34Bob,&#34 said a voice that was a few decibels above normal conversation. &#34What is the status of Greenfield?&#34 Robert's eyes lowered onto the speaker and he quickly came back from his daydream."

                 "Bob was in a meeting. He told his boss about the environmental impact of Greenfield's new building proposal, about the harm to local watersheds and potential runoff problems. The boss roughly asked him a few questions about costs, and then he moved on to the next person.  An hour later, Robert left the office and went home. The commute was the same as always, no traffic. That was one of the benefits at working half the day from home. Robert listened to KZQD on the radio and hummed with the soft rock radio. There was a car accident on I-5. Robert slowed down to investigate the damage. 30 minutes later, Robert was home. Robert always liked the first hour of being home, his 2 kids were still in school and his wife was working. It was only him and his dog."

    "&#34Here Buddy!&#34 Robert called as he entered the house. Instantly the patter of footsteps from 60 pound golden retriever echoed in his ears. Lunch time. First Robert fed Buddy, then himself. Today's entree was canned soup. As he read the newspaper, Buddy ran laps up and down the hall. At least one of us has a lot of energy Robert mused. Putting down the paper, Robert quickly finished his lunch and changed into running clothes. &#34Here Buddy!&#34 said Robert as he opened the door. Buddy came running out, eagerly panting in anticipation of the walk. "

    "Robert was quite fortunate to live right next to a creek where he and his neighbors used as a walking trail.  Within minutes, the hum of city cars was replaced with the hum of insects. Buddy darted along the river's bank after a squirrel, stopping only after the squirrel jumped into a tree. He then started barking at it. &#34Buddy!&#34 cried Robert sharply, trying to restore the ambiance of the creek. He snapped his fingers and Buddy came back to Robert's side. However, after a moment, Buddy became occupied following a dragonfly. Robert continued to walk,  enjoying the calmness of the day. Once again he started to daydream and his mind slowly drifted away from the creek. He walked on mindlessly, lost amidst the depths of his own mind."

    "&#34Arrrrrgggg! Landlubber Ahoy!&#34 <br>Bob turned his head to see the commotion. In the center of the creek was a ship made from two large logs tied together with string. Standing on top of the ship was an 8 year old boy with a giant toothy grin. In one hand he held a gray foam scimitar, and on his head rested a large black pirate hat. The kid wore swim trunks and a blue tank-top that was drenched with water. The kid pointed the tip of the sword towards Robert. "
    ,
    "&#34I am Blackbeard. King of these treacherous waters. Hand over your booty or walk the plank!&#34 exclaimed the kid. <br>Robert's expression of flabbergast was drowned out by a large splash. Buddy had jumped into the creek and was paddling towards the ship. <br>&#34Buddy!&#34 cried Robert. <br>&#34Sea monster! Prepare for battle!&#34 rallied Blackbeard. &#34HUUUURRRAAAAAAHHHH!&#34 <br>Buddy's monstrous first attempt to board the ship were thwarted by Blackbeard's steel. Unfazed, Buddy tried once more to board the ship. He reached both paws over the edge of the log."

["&#34Arrrgggg!&#34 cried Blackbeard. <br>He lifted the sword over his head with 2 hands and did a jumping slash at Buddy. Buddy yelped in terror and pushed away from the pirate ship. The force of the motion rotated the ship and Blackbeard's cry of anguish was lost as he landed in the water. "
    ,
"&#34Kid!&#34 screamed Robert. <br>Without thinking Robert dove into the water and started swimming towards the submerged boy. As Robert adjusted to the warmth of the water, a head popped out of the water and gave a jovial laugh. Blackbeard climbed back onto his ship and turned to Robert who was treading water in the creek feeling foolish. <br>&#34Man overboard! Throw the rope.&#34 He said and thrust out his hand. Robert grabbed the hand and pulled himself onto the ship. He was amazed that the logs could hold his weight and even more surprised when he found that he could stand on them."

["&#34What's your name kid?&#34 panted Robert." + 
	"<br>  &#34Blackbeard!&#34 exclaimed the kid confidently. &#34Welcome to the Black Oyster first mate. . .?&#34 	<br>&#34Robert.&#34 " +
	"<br>&#34Robert's a boring name. You are hereby first mate Scabber!&#34 delcared Blackbeard. " +
	"<br>&#34Kid, where's your family?&#34 inquired Robert. " +
	"<br> &#34The name's Blackbeard.&#34 said Blackbeard authoritatively" +
	"<br> &#34Blackbeard&#34 emphasized Robert, &#34where is your family?&#34 " +
	"<br> &#34The only family a pirate has is his ship,&#34 smiled Blackbeard. &#34Oh that reminds me, you have to do the pledge to be part of the ship. Repeat after me. I, first mate Scabber. . .&#34 "
,
 "He gestured towards Robert to finish the sentence. Robert just stared at the kid, wondering what to do next. " +
	"<br>&#34You have to say the pledge Scabber,&#34 whined Blackbeard. &#34Or else I'll have to make you walk the plank. I, first mate Scabber. . .&#34 " +
	"<br>&#34I, first mate Scabber,&#34 answered Robert deciding to humor the kid. " +
	"<br>&#34Do solemly swear&#34 " +
	"<br>&#34Do solemly swear&#34 " +

["&#34WOOHOO!&#34 shouted Blackbeard.  Robert smiled.  &#34Now that we're a team, our first adventure Scabber is to retrieve my hat from the sea monster.&#34" + 
	"<br>Blackbeard pointed downstream with his sword. Around a bend, Buddy was on a bank, chewing on Blackbeard's pirate hat." +
	"<br>&#34Hoist the sails!&#34 declared Blackbeard and he started pulling on an invisible rope. Robert stared blankly. &#34Scabber, you have to help me pull up the sail,&#34 said Blackbeard gesturing towards his hands. Robert caught on quickly and started to hoist up the sail. "
    ,
 "&#34Good work first mate,&#34 smiled Blackbeard. He made an spyglass with his hands and directed it towards Buddy. &#34Target set at North-East. Distance, 200 miles. Ready to sail Scabber?&#34 	&#34Aye aye captain,&#34 replied Robert with a trace amount of enthusiasm. " +
	"<br>&#34Perfect! Hoist the anchor!&#34 Blackbeard and Scabber then pulled up the anchor and the Black Oyster slowly drifted down the stream. Robert looked down and saw rays of light reflecting off the water to illuminate the glowing green canopy above. He saw the rustling of branches caused by birds and squirrels. The gentle breeze gave him a chill and he remembered that his clothes were drenched. As the ship sailed towards the bend, Robert sat down and put his legs in the cool, smooth water."

["&#34Arrrrgggg sea monster!&#34 announced Blackbeard as he raised his sword. &#34Return my captain's hat or face your death!&#34 "
    ,
 "Buddy looked up with the hat in his mouth. <br>&#34On your head scallywag. CHARGE!&#34 Blackbeard put the blade of his sword between his teeth and jumped off the Black Oyster. Frightened, Buddy paddled downstream with the hat. As Blackbeard swam towards Buddy, he turned his head towards Robert. &#34Scabber, you need to charge with me.&#34 <br><br>Robert gently lowered himself in the water and began treading water. The creek looked different from Robert's new perspective. The water gained a bright green tinge to compliment the blue. Shadows from the canopy danced over the currents, swaying back and forth in the breeze. Small fish swam towards Robert, enticed by the new currents. He heard the quiet crashing of water against the bank shores and the splashing of Blackbeard and Buddy up ahead. Robert grabbed the back on the ship and started to push it downstream. He passed the bank. Buddy was far downstream and Blackbeard was just treading water. As Robert came up with the ship, Blackbeard said, &#34The sea monster got away.&#34 "

 ,
"&#34Aye aye captain,&#34 said Robert as he helped Blackbeard on the ship." + 
	"<br>&#34Well get him though,&#34 stated Blackbeard. &#34We will follow him to the end of the world if we have to.&#34 " +
	"<br>&#34Captain,&#34 said Scabber, &#34I have a plan.&#34 "

["Blackbeard nodded in tacit approval." +
	"<br>&#34Buddy!&#34 yelled Robert as he snapped his finger. Buddy turned around from downstream and started to paddle back. Robert jumped off the of the ship and push it next to the shore. Buddy and his owner reunited on the sandy bank. Robert gave his dog a pat on the head and took the hat back. Scabber turned to Blackbeard, who was standing on the ship a foot from the bank. 	&#34Captain,&#34 said Scabber, &#34Here is your hat.&#34 Blackbeard beamed as he placed this pirate hat back on to his head."

["&#34Good work Scabber!&#34 complimented Blackbeard. &#34Ready for the next adventure?&#34 " +
	"<br>&#34Not today captain. I have to go back to being a landlubber.&#34 responded Robert. " +
	"<br>&#34Arrrgggg,&#34 growled Blackbeard. &#34The sea monster ate my first mate. May you rest well with Davy Jones. Farewell Scabber!&#34" 
    
 ,
 "&#34Farewell captain,&#34 replied Robert. He grabbed the ship and gave it a gentle push back into the center of the creek. As the logs floated away, the kid with the pirate hat turned around and waved goodbye. Robert waved back. He then signaled to Buddy and began to walk back home. Once home, Robert changed his clothes and showered. His finished his work, greeted his kids as they came home, and started making dinner. His wife came home and they ate dinner as a family. At night, Robert watched some TV, turned it off, and went to bed early. At work, he had another meeting. Under the fluorescence glow, a man was talking a few decibels louder than a normal conversation. As Robert started to day dream, he moved his pen along the table, as if it was floating down a river.
